# RPSLS
A Server/Client implementation of the game Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.
Built by Aashish Agrawal and Karan Ahuja for a class, some basic startup code provided by teacher Mark Hallenbeck.

This is a Maven Project, and can be run using "mvn exec:java".
You must open a server instance using this command (the P3Project folder).
Multiple clients can connect to the server (instantiated using the same command, from the P3Client Folder).
The client picks the client they wish to challenge, and the game begins.
