# RPSLS
A Server/Client implementation of the game Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.
Built by Aashish Agrawal and Karan Ahuja for a class, some basic startup code provided by teacher Mark Hallenbeck.

This is a Maven Project, and can be run using "mvn exec:java".
You must open a server, and multiple clients may connect to the server.
The client picks the client they wish to challenge, and the game begins.
